## Hello, World!

[insert picture]

Hi! My name is Evelyn, and I am a Library Desktop Technician at the University of Southern Mississippi.

## Education

I completed a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science at the University of Southern Mississippi (USM) in May 2024. I graduated Summa Cum Laude, and completed a [thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bB06Dm8ly4YJcIQqq-Z4X2EGiO_BnYK7/view?usp=sharing) in the Honors College.

### The Unecessary Details

My thesis was completed outside of my major, in My University's [School of Media and Communications](https://www.usm.edu/media-communication/index.php).The title, "Groomer Discourse: A Transgender-sensitive Critical Discourse Analysis of Queerphobic Hate Speech on Twitter" is a *bit* of a misnomer, as I was going into the research process without much prior experience in Communications research (beyond a Political Communications class I took in Honors, and a brief stint working asan undergraduate research assistant). To put in the words of the infamous *Reviewer 2* who reviewed this paper for SCAA 2025 in Norfolk, Virginia...

> "At some points throughout the manuscript, however, the authors call their work "rhetorical analysis" and even go so far as to cite Burke (which I don't think adds much, by the way). I think the authors need to decide whether this is a discourse analysis or a rhetorical analysis. There are major methodological differences between the two fields and I think choosing one or the other would allow them to clarify their intervention."

I do not mean to say that my research is entirely without merit! But what it essentially boils down to is this: **I get to read transphobic tweets, categorize them, and then make charts that visualize my categorizations.** 

Since graduating and starting work at USM, I've taken coursework to supplement my thesis research and undergraduate coursework. To borrow a concept from the game [Disco Elysium](https://store.steampowered.com/app/632470/Disco_Elysium__The_Final_Cut/) (go play it or watch a playthrough if you haven't already, but I'd recommend a blind playthrough), my current *mind project* is finding a way to marry my education in computer science and interest in politics and communications... without getting a poverty wage.  

<!-- ## """Philosophy"""

I use this term kind of losely, as the *fundamental* motivator underpinning this site is self-expression. Above that is a philosophy of anarcho-communism (let's hope the hiring managers didn't scroll this far down into this section [hence, its location towards the middle of the webpage]). In my rotted STEM-lord brain, here's how I come to understand the definition.
